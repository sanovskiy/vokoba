# Vokoba Language Guide

**Version: Alpha**
**Date: November 2025**

Vokoba is an experiment in re-engineering the very mechanism of language. It is an *a priori oligosynthetic* language that rejects the chaos of natural languages and the cold sterility of logical languages in favor of a new paradigm: **direct image encoding**.

Vokoba does not use word-labels. Instead, it operates with "conceptual atoms" — roots that are combined to synthesize meaning, much like thought combines images. It is a language where context is not a problem but becomes a resource: grammatical markers explicitly point to shared knowledge and focus of attention, while the system of **finitives** integrates emotional nuance into the very structure of a sentence.

Vokoba's goal is to become not merely a means of communication, but an **operating system for the mind**, fostering clarity, systematic thinking, and self-reflection. This guide is an introduction to that system.

## **0. Preamble: Conventions and Principles of Presentation**

This guide describes the structure and usage of the Vokoba language. For clarity and ease of learning, the following conventions and notations are used throughout the text.

### **0.1. Notation Conventions**

*   **Phonetic Transcription:** The pronunciation of words and roots is provided using the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA) and enclosed in forward slashes.
    *   Example: `vokoba` — /vokoba/.
*   **Word Decomposition:** A hyphen is used to demonstrate the structure of compound words.
    *   Example: `ron-i-min-a` (mighty spirit).
*   **Grammatical Labels:**
    *   `n.` — noun
    *   `adj.` — adjective
    *   `v.` — verb
    *   `adv.` — adverb
    *   `part.` — particle
    *   `fin.` — finitive
*   **Optional Elements:** Sentence elements that can be omitted without losing grammatical correctness are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.
    *   Example sentence structure: `[Q] [T] S V O [F]`.
    *   Example from speech: `[Tano] mika vime lyma.` — `(Now)` I see the light.

### **0.2. Key Language Principles**

When learning Vokoba, it is helpful to keep its fundamental foundations in mind:

1.  **Principle of Composition:** The meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts. Complex ideas are expressed by combining simple roots.
2.  **Principle of Contextuality:** Context is a legitimate and managed part of the language. For instance, markers like **`je`** (contextual) and **`lo`** (focus) grammatically encode knowledge shared between interlocutors and accentuate key elements of an utterance (see section 3.2).
3.  **Principle of Emotional Grammar:** The speaker's attitude towards the utterance is a full-fledged component of communication and is expressed using **finitives** (see section 6).

### **0.3. On the Language's Status**

Vokoba is currently in the **active development (Alpha)** stage. Its vocabulary, root base, and some grammatical nuances may be refined and expanded. This document represents a current snapshot of the evolving system.

Communities and tools for learning the language are in the process of being formed. This guide serves as a primary source and an invitation to participate in the development of the Vokoba project.

## 1. Alphabet and Phonetics

The Vokoba alphabet consists of **23 letters**, each corresponding to a single sound. Ambiguity in pronunciation is eliminated.

### Alphabet and Corresponding Sounds:
| Letter | Sound | Example                                    |
|--------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| a      | /a/   | as in "father"                             |
| b      | /b/   | as in "book"                               |
| d      | /d/   | as in "door"                               |
| e      | /ɛ/   | as in "bed"                                |
| f      | /f/   | as in "face"                               |
| g      | /g/   | as in "god"                                |

| i      | /i/   | as in "see"                                |
| j      | /ʒ/   | as in "measure", French "jour"             |
| k      | /k/   | as in "cat"                                |
| l      | /l/   | as in "light"                              |
| m      | /m/   | as in "mother"                             |
| n      | /n/   | as in "night"                              |
| o      | /o/   | as in Spanish 'todo' or Italian 'notte'    |
| p      | /p/   | as in "paper"                              |
| r      | /r/   | as in Spanish "pero" (alveolar tap/trill)  |
| s      | /s/   | as in "sun"                                |
| t      | /t/   | as in "table"                              |
| u      | /u/   | as in "push"                               |
| v      | /v/   | as in "voice"                              |
| x      | /ʃ/   | as in Russian "шум"                        |  (a clear, slightly dark /ʃ/, like English "shoe" but with the tongue pulled back a bit)
| y      | /y/   | as in French "tu", German "über"           |
| z      | /z/   | as in "zoo"                                |

**Note:** All sounds are pronounced clearly and distinctly, without reduction. Stress in words typically falls on the primary meaningful syllable.

## 2. Word Formation

### 2.1. Roots
Vokoba is built on **roots** — basic semantic units that combine to form complex concepts. A root without a part-of-speech affix has no standalone meaning.

| zel  | /zɛl/         | dream, hope                              |

**Note:** The root list may expand. New roots are added with attention to uniqueness and minimal semantic overlap.

#### Part-of-speech endings:
- **-a / -ka** — noun (name of an object or phenomenon): *lyma* — "light", *vita* — "life"  
- **-i / -ki** — adjective (quality): *lymi* — "shining/luminous", *viti* — "alive"  
- **-e / -ke** — verb (action): *lyme* — "to shine", *vite* — "to live"  
- **-u / -ku** — adverb: *lymu* — "brightly"; *vitu* — "lively", "vividly", or "with life/energy" (context-dependent)
- **-ai / -kai** — finitive (see Section 6)  
- **-o / -ko** — numeral (digit): *miko* — "1", *tiko* — "2" (see "Numerals" section)

**Important:** A root cannot be used on its own—it must carry a part-of-speech ending.  
**Euphony rule:** If the root ends in a vowel, the form with the **k-** prefix is used (-ka, -ki, -ke, -ku, -kai), as per Section 2.2.0.

---

### 2.2. Forming Compound Concepts
Complex concepts are created by combining roots in two ways:

#### 2.2.0 Phonotactic Principle (the core rule of euphony)
Every word in Vokoba must follow one of two alternating vowel-consonant patterns:
- **CVCV** (consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel…)
- **VCVC** (vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant…)

This rule applies to the entire word, including roots, linkers, and endings.

**Purpose:** to avoid consecutive vowels (VV) and hard-to-pronounce consonant clusters (CC).

#### 2.2.1. Simple Compounding
- **Description**: The first root provides the base meaning; subsequent roots refine or specify it.
- **Part of speech**: Determined by the final ending (-a, -i, -e, -o, -u).

**Examples:**
- *da-vok* (*da-vok-a*) — "existence + sound" → "sound as phenomenon" (noun)  
- *bon(-i)-kor* (*bon-i-kor-a*) — "good + feeling" → "affection" (noun)  
- *pur(-i)-mer* (*pur-i-mer-a*) — "purity + liquid" → "water" (noun) (lit. 'pure liquid')"

If a root junction creates **VV** or **CC**, a linking element is inserted:
- **Between vowels** → insert the consonant **-h-** (a phonetic buffer): *da + esa* → *dahesa* (not *daesa*).  
- **Between consonants** → insert a vowel to restore the CVCV/VCVC pattern. (For guidance on which vowel to use, see 2.2.2.)

**Examples:**  
- *esa + vok* → *esavoke* = VCVCVC  
- *da + vok* → *davoka* = CVCVC  
- *da + esa* → *daesaka* = CVVCV → **invalid**, so: *da-h-esa* → *dahesaka*  
- *pon + reg* → *ponrega* = CVCCCV → **invalid**, so: *pon-i-reg-a* → *ponirega* = CVCVCVCV

#### 2.2.2. Compounding with Internal Endings
- **Description**: Additional roots describe qualities or actions **relating to the final (main) root**.  
- **Internal ending**: A part-of-speech ending is inserted **between roots** to clarify their grammatical relationship.  
- **Final part of speech**: The word ends with an outer ending (*-a/-ka*, *-i/-ki*, *-e/-ke*, *-u/-ku*) that defines the word’s overall role in the sentence.

If inserting a linker creates a **VV sequence**, the buffer consonant **-h-** is used:  
*bon + i + alu* → *bon + i + h + alu* = *bonihalu(ka)*

**Examples:**  
- *pon-i-reg-a* — "point-like (*pon-i*) + order (*reg-a*)" → **"straight line"** (noun, lit. "linear order")  
- *pon-i-reg-i* — **"linear"**, "pertaining to a straight line" (adjective)  
- *pon-i-reg-e* — **"to straighten"** (verb)  
- *mon-e-ki-ob-a* — "thinking (*mon-e-ki*)(verb as a quality) + tangible entity (*ob-a*)" → "thinking thing" (noun, lit. "material entity that thinks")

---

### 2.3. Plural Form
The plural is formed by adding the suffix **-r**:  
- *vita* — "life", *vitar* — "lives"  
- *pona* — "point", *ponar* — "points"  
- *mika* — "I", *mikar* — "we"

The **-r** suffix applies to **all parts of speech** (yes, even verbs and adjectives).  
It expresses **semantic plurality**, not just grammatical number:  
- **Nouns**: multiple entities (*vitar* = multiple lives)  
- **Adjectives/adverbs**: multiple manifestations of a quality (*bonir* = "good in many ways", "variously good")  
- **Verbs**: repeated or distributed action (*viter* = "to live repeatedly", "to live in many places/ways")  
- **Temporal markers** (see 3.2): recurring or iterated time (*pador* = "in the past, completed, and repeated")

### 2.4. Gender Marking
Personal pronouns are **gender-neutral by default**, but can be specified when needed:
- *mika* — "I" (neutral), *mikar* — "we"  
- *tika* — "you" (sg., neutral), *tikar* — "you" (pl.)  
- *zeka* — "it" (neutral), *zekar* — "they"  
- *zemaka* — "he", *zejaka* — "she"  
- *mimaka* — "I" (male), *mijaka* — "I" (female)

> **Note**: Gender specification is optional and used only when relevant to the context.

---

### 2.5. Comparative and Superlative Forms
Comparatives and superlatives are formed by **combining the adjective** (which may itself be a compound) with the roots **ato** ("magnitude, size") or **alu** ("height, peak"), placed **before** the main adjective.

- **Comparative**:  
  - *ato + {adj}* → "more {adj}"  
  - *nehato + {adj}* → "less {adj}"  
  A linking vowel (*-i-*) or the adjective linker *-ki-* may be inserted for euphony, but is optional when the combination flows naturally.  
  Examples:  
  - *atokilymi* / *atolymi* — "brighter"  
  - *nehatokilymi* / *nehatolymi* — "less bright"

- **Superlative**:  
  - *alu + {adj}* → "most {adj}"  
  - *nehalu + {adj}* → "least {adj}"  
  The linker *-ki-* is usually included for smoother pronunciation.  
  Examples:  
  - *alukilymi* — "brightest"  
  - *nehalukilymi* — "least bright"
  
> **Note**: The choice between forms (e.g. *atolymi* vs. *atokilymi*) depends on phonotactic flow and stylistic preference.

---

### 2.6. Fine-tuning Meaning: Style, Embodiment, and Action
Vokoba allows precise distinction between an **abstract quality** and its **active, embodied form** through a secondary suffix series: **-ta / -ti / -tu / -te**.  
These suffixes attach to **fully formed words** (already carrying their part-of-speech ending: -a, -i, -u, -e) to express **how a quality is manifested, embodied, or enacted**.

This is not inflection—it’s **semantic derivation**, often yielding more concise expressions than full compounding.

#### Examples:
- **-ta** — noun derived from a quality, action, or manner:  
  *bonu* (adv., "kindly") → *bonuta* — "kindness as a manner of acting" (i.e. **goodwill, benevolence**)  
  *boni* (adj., "kind") → *bonita* — "kindness as a trait"  
  *bone* (v., "to do good") → *boneta* — "an act of kindness"
  *libu* → *libuta* — "carefreeness" (lit. "carefree manner as a state")  
- **-tu** — adverbial suffix expressing **manner or style**, derived from **any part of speech**:  
  *liba* (noun, "freedom") → *libatu* — "in the manner of freedom", "freely"  
  *libi* (adj., "free") → *libitu* — "in a free way"  
  *libe* (v., "to free") → *libetu* — "in a liberating way"  
  *libu* (adv., "freely") → *libutu* — "in an extra-carefree way" (intensified or stylized manner)

- - **-te** — verb-forming suffix that **enacts any concept as an action**:  
  It turns a noun, adjective, adverb, or even a verb into a verb meaning  
  **"to act as [X]", "to embody [X] in action", or "to perform in the manner of [X]"**.  
  - *pura* (n., "purity") → *purate* — "to purify by embodying purity"  
  - *puri* (adj., "pure") → *purite* — "to act purely", "to perform with purity"  
  - *puru* (adv., "purely") → *purute* — "to act in a purely purifying way"  
  - *pure* (v., "to be pure") → *purete* — "to be pure with emphasis or intensity" (e.g. "to meticulously maintain purity")
  - *han-i* (adj., "beautiful") → *hanite* — "to act beautifully", "to grace with beauty"  
  - *han-a* (n., "beauty") → *hanate* — "to embody beauty in action", "to be a living adornment"
  > **Note**: This is distinct from plural verbs (e.g. *pur**er*** = "to purify repeatedly").  
  > *-te* adds **qualitative intensity or conceptual embodiment**, not repetition.
  
### 2.7. Stress

- **Single-root words**: stress falls on the only root: **bóni**  
- **Within compounds**:  
  - Stress falls on the **final meaningful root** (not on linkers or grammatical endings): **poniréga**  
  - Interfixes and affixes never carry stress.  
- **In finitives**: the **a** in **-ai** is always stressed: **korái**, **bonái**

## 3. Grammar

### 3.1. Sentence Structure  
The basic word order is: **[Q] T S V O [F]**  
(Interrogative + Tense + Subject + Verb + Object + [Finitive])

- **Q (Interrogative)**: Marks the sentence as a question and specifies its type (who?, where?, when?, etc.).  
- **T (Tense)**: Indicates temporal context and aspect. May be omitted for axioms or universal truths.  
- **S (Subject)**: The agent performing the action.  
- **V (Verb)**: The action or state.  
- **O (Object)**: The entity affected by the action (optional).  
- **F (Finitive)**: A special part of speech expressing the speaker’s attitude or emotional stance toward the statement (optional).

**Example**:  
*pado mika vime sora* — "I saw the sky (in the past)."  (lit. "past I see sky")

### 3.2. Tense and Aspect

#### Temporal Markers 
Indicate **when** the action takes place:  
- **pa** — past  
- **ta** — present  
- **fa** — future  
- **na** — "never-time" (atemporal negation: events that never occur)

#### Aspect Markers  
Indicate **how** the action unfolds:  
- **do** — perfective (completed)  
- **no** — imperfective (ongoing, habitual)  
- **xo** /ʃo/ — probabilistic (likely, possible)

> **Note**: Temporal and aspect markers combine freely to form compound Tenses.

**Examples** (selected combinations):  
- *pado* — "past perfective" (a completed action in the past)  
- *tano* — "present imperfective" (ongoing or habitual present)  
- *fado* — "future perfective" (an action that will be completed)  
- *faxo* — "probable future"  
- *nado* — "never perfective" (something that has never happened)

#### Atemporal statements (SVO without tense marker)
Used for universal truths or eternal facts:  
- *kava kave* — "The river flows."

#### Iterativity (Repeated Actions)  
When an action occurs multiple times, **plurality** is marked with **-r** — but **location matters**:

- **-r on the Tense** (*pador*) → repetition **across time** (the action happened on multiple occasions)  
- **-r on the verb** (*venker*) → repetition **in manner** (cyclical, intermittent, or distributed action)

#### Examples:
- *mika venke do [je]* — "I go there."  
- *pano mika venke [do] je* — "I was going there."  
- *faxo mika venke [do] je* — "I will probably go there."  
- *pador mika venke [do] je* — "I went there repeatedly (on different past occasions)."  
- *pado mika venker [vi] je* — "I kept walking around there (repeated or habitual motion)."  
- *nado mika venke [do] je* — "I have never gone there."  

---

### 3.3. Particles and Conjunctions

- **ni** — possession: *lyma ni mika* — "my light"  
- **vi** — inside: *lyma vi vola* — "light inside space"  
- **ma** — between: *mika ma lyma tu mera* — "I am between light and water"  
- **ot** — from: *lyma ot mika* — "light from me"  
- **do** — to/toward: *lyma do tika* — "light to you"  
- **va** — above: *lyma va mika* — "light above me"  
- **neva** — below (inversion of *va*): *mera neva mika* — "water below me"  
- **ta** — for: *lyma ta mika* — "light for me"  
- **lo** — focus marker: highlights the following element as the center of attention:  
  *mika vime lo lyma* — "I see **the light** (and nothing else)"  
- **ri** — introduces a declarative subordinate clause ("that"):  
  *mika vime lyma boni* — "I see good light" (as description)  
  *mika vime ri lyma bonu* — "I see **that** the light is good"  
- **bi** - a conjunction that plays a role similar to "but." It contrasts a subsequent statement with the previous one.
- **je** — contextual marker ("the aforementioned"):  
  *mona ni je* — "the thought about **that** (we were just talking about)"  
- **si** — "if / when", **sida** — "then", **nesida** — "otherwise"  
- **vesi** — "if it were..." (hypothetical)  
- **nesi** — "if not"  
- **tu** — "and"  
- **ro** — "or"

---

### 3.4. Negation and Inversion

- **ne- / neh-** — **inversion** (opposite meaning):  
  *neboni* — "bad" (opposite of "good")  
  *nehaluki* — "low" (opposite of "high")  

- **nai- / naih-** — **negation** (absence of quality):  
  *naiboni* — "not good" (lacking goodness, but not necessarily bad)  
  *naihaluki* — "not tall" (not possessing height, but not short)

> **Note**: Use **neh-** and **naih-** before roots that begin with a vowel (to avoid vowel clusters).


---

## 4. Interrogative Sentences  
Structure: **Q + [T] + SVO**  
- **Q** — interrogative word, always at the beginning.  
- **[T]** — tense marker (optional).

### Interrogative Words  
Formed by adding the suffix **-su** (after consonants) or **-asu** (after vowels) to a **semantic root**.

#### Common interrogatives:
- *persu* — "who?" (*per* = someone)  
- *obasu* — "what?" (*ob* = tangible entity)  
- *volasu* — "where?" (*vol* = space)  
- *temasu* — "when?" (*tem* = time)  
- *esasu* — "how?" (*esa* = expression)  
- *genasu* — "why?" (*gen* = origin)  
- *dasu* — "for what purpose?" (*da* = existence → "why exist?")  
- *sumasu* — "how many/much?" (*sum* = addition)  
- *filasu* — "whose?" (*fil* = kinship)

#### Complex interrogatives:
- *karasu* — "what material?" (*kar* = matter)  
- *vixasu* — "what color?" (*vix* = color)

> **Plurality**: Add **-r** to the interrogative word to ask about **multiple items**:  
> - *karasur* — "what materials?"  
> - *vixasur* — "what colors?"

> **Note**: Plural questions imply an **enumerative answer** (a list, not a single item).

### Examples:
- *Karasu je oba?* — "What is this made of?"  
- *Karasur je oba?* — "What materials is this made of?" (expecting a list)

## 5. Reserved 

## 6. Finitives

Finitives are a unique part of speech in Vokoba that express the **speaker’s emotional stance or attitude** toward the statement. They **always appear at the end of a sentence**, do **not modify** the action or object, and are **optional**—used solely to convey the speaker’s mood or tone.

---

### 6.1. Finitive Endings
- **-ai / -kai** — **conversational** (neutral, everyday tone)  
- **-afai / -fai** — **formal/polite** (official speech, oaths, solemn declarations)  
- **-arai / -rai** — **sarcastic** (ironic, mocking tone)  
- **-amai / -mai** — **poetic** (elevated, lyrical, artistic tone)

> **Note**: Use **-kai, -fai, -rai, -mai** after roots ending in a vowel (for euphony).

---

### 6.2. Usage Rules
- **Position**: Finitives **always come at the end** of the sentence. Only **one finitive** is allowed per sentence.  
- **Root blending**: To express complex emotions, **up to two roots** may be combined. The first root sets the primary tone; the second adds nuance. A linking vowel (*-i-*, *-a-*, *-e-*) is inserted if needed for smooth pronunciation.  
  - Example: *bon-i-kor-ai* — "joyfully and passionately"  
- **Negation**: Finitives can take **nai-** (absence) or **ne-** (opposite) to shift the emotional tone.  
  - Example: *nebonai* — "with disappointment", *naikorai* — "without enthusiasm"  
- **Interrogative finitives**: The finitive *resai* (or its compounds) can form **rhetorical or emotionally charged questions** without an initial interrogative word.  
  - Example: *Tika vime lyma resai?* — "You saw the light? (I’m curious.)"  
- **Ellipsis**: In dialogue, a finitive alone can stand for a full utterance, expressing mood as a complete response.  
  - Examples:  
    - *Je lyme?* ("Is that thing glowing?") → *Alukai!* ("I declare solemnly: yes!")  
    - *Resenamai?* ("What’s your name?") — Lit. "I ask, with curiosity about your name."

### 6.3. Common Finitive Examples

| Root (meaning)           | Finitive | Speaker’s attitude               | Example sentence                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **suf** (vagueness)      | *sufai*  | with doubt                       | *Zeka monapake sufai...* — "He knows... (**I’m unsure**)"        |
| **bon** (good)           | *bonai*  | with joy                         | *Tika zamke bonai!* — "You did it! (**I’m happy**)"              |
| **alu** (height, peak)   | *alukai* | with solemnity                   | *Lyma lyme alukai!* — "The light shines! (**I speak solemnly**)" |
| **lib** (freedom)        | *libai*  | with carefreeness                | *Venke libai!* — "Let’s go! (**I feel carefree**)"               |
| **res** (question)       | *resai*  | with curiosity                   | *Tika vime lyma resai?* — "You saw the light? (**I’m curious**)" |
| **zel** (dream, hope)    | *zelai*  | with hope                        | *Tano mika venke zelai.* — "I’m going now. (**I hope**)"         |
| **san** (health, care)   | *sanai*  | with care                        | *Tika zamke sanai!* — "You did it! (**I care**)"                 |
| **pul** (interaction)    | *pulai*  | with warmth                      | *Tika venke pulai!* — "You’re coming. (**I welcome you**)"       |


### 6.4. Compound Finitives  
Compound finitives combine two roots to express a nuanced or complex emotional stance:  
- **bon-i-kor-ai** — "with joy and passion":  
  *Pado tika zamke bonikorai!* — "You did it! (I’m saying this joyfully and passionately)"  
- **suf-i-res-ai** — "with doubt and curiosity":  
  *Pado zeka vime lyma sufiresai?* — "Did he see the light? (I’m asking this doubtfully)"  
- **zel-i-lib-ai** — "with hope and carefreeness":  
  *Mika venke zelilibai!* — "I’m going. (I’m saying this dreamily and carefree)"

### 6.5. Registers in Action  
- **Conversational** (`-ai` / `-kai`):  
  *Mika vime lyma korai!* — "I saw the light! (I’m speaking with excitement)"  
- **Formal/Polite** (`-afai` / `-fai`):  
  *Lyma lyme alufai!* — "The light shines! (I’m speaking solemnly and respectfully)"  
- **Sarcastic** (`-arai` / `-rai`):  
  *Mika vime lyma korarai!* — "I saw the light! (I’m pretending to be excited—but I’m not)"

### 6.6. Action Modifiers  
An additional root can be prefixed to a finitive to specify the **mode of utterance**—not just *what* is said, but *how* it is being performed (e.g., as a question, command, declaration, etc.).  
Examples:  
- *Tika zamke je resevitai?* — "You did it? — I’m **inquiring** (not merely stating), energetically/insistently."  
  (`res-e` = "to question" as a verb)  
- *Tika zamke je ronehakokai!* — "You will do it. — I’m **commanding**!"  
  (`ron-e` = "to exercise authority"; `ako` = "change, development" → implies imperative force toward transformation)
  
### 6.7. Dialogue Examples

1. **Simple dialogue**:  
   - A: *pado tika vime zeka?* — "Did you see him?"  
   - B: *korai!* — "[Yes!] (with excitement)"  
   - A: *temasu?* — "When?"  
   - B: *nemikoregi lymatema zelai!* — "Yesterday. (with hope)"  
     (*"nemikoregi lymatema" in this context inverts "the first day" (mikoregi lymatema) to mean "the first day in the past"—i.e., yesterday.*)

2. **Sarcastic reply**:  
   - A: *pado tika zamke?* — "Did you do it?"  
   - B: *bonarai...* — "Oh sure... (sarcastically)"

3. **Rhetorical question**:  
   - *zeka monapake do je sufiresai?* — "Does he even know that? (I’m asking with doubt and curiosity)"

### 6.8. Notes

- Finitives do **not** replace adverbs that describe *how* an action is performed. Finitives express **only the speaker’s attitude** toward the utterance.  
  - Adverbs (`-u` / `-ku`) describe **the manner of the action**.  
  - Finitives (`-ai`, etc.) express **the speaker’s emotional stance** toward the statement.

**Crucial distinction between adverb and finitive**:  
- *Adverb*: *tano tika vene bonu* → "Right now you’re walking joyfully."  
- *Finitive*: *tano tika vene bonai* → "Right now you’re walking. (I’m saying this joyfully.)"

## 7. Example Sentences

- *pado mika vime lyma* — "In the past, I saw the light."  
- *tano mika monapake do tika* — "Right now, I know you."  
- *si tika dapake mona do je, sida esavoke* — "If you know that, then speak."

## 8. Number System in Vokoba

### **8.1. Basic Numerals**

Vokoba uses a positional numeral system based on digit grouping and hierarchical orders of magnitude. Numbers are formed by combining digit roots with rank markers, following a fully regular structure.

#### **8.1.1. Cardinal Digits**

- **neko** — 0 (“not-a-digit”)
- **miko** — 1 (“my digit”)
- **tiko** — 2 (“your digit”)
- **zeko** — 3 (“their digit”)
- **sano** — 4 (“healthy digit”)
- **tago** — 5 (“segmented digit”)
- **rego** — 6 (“ordered digit”)
- **libo** — 7 (“free digit”)
- **mero** — 8 (“liquid digit”)
- **aluko** — 9 (“peak digit”)

The parenthetical descriptions are mnemonic aids and reflect the conceptual grounding of each digit.

These digits serve as building blocks for larger numbers when combined with rank markers.

#### **8.1.2. Base Quantities**

- **ronatiko** — ten (lit. “power of two”: *ron* = power + *tiko* = 2 → 10¹)  
- **ronazeko** — hundred (lit. “power of three”: *ron* + *zeko* = 3 → 10²)

> Note: The pattern continues geometrically: `rona- + [digit]` indicates 10^(digit−1).

### **8.2. Rank Markers (Orders of Magnitude)**

The concept of **rank** allows Vokoba to express large magnitudes such as thousands, millions, and beyond. Each rank has a dedicated morpheme:

**-volo / -volor** — general suffix for high-order magnitudes (millions, billions, etc.)

- **tivolo** — thousand (10³)
- **zevolo** — million (10⁶)
- **sanvolo** — billion (10⁹)

### **8.3. Number Grouping**

Numbers are grouped by rank, with each group explicitly marked.

#### **8.3.1. Constructing Large Numbers**

Each group corresponds to a specific rank. Digits within the group are expressed using base quantities (`ronatiko`, `ronazeko`) and combined with the appropriate rank marker:

- **1,000,000** = **[miko] zevolo**  
- **1,000** = **[miko] tivolo**  
- **123,000,000,000** = **miko ronazeko tiko ronatikor zeko sanvolor**

#### **8.3.2. Full Example: 123,456,789**

Written out in full:

```
[miko] ronazeko tiko ronatikor zeko zevolor, sano ronazekor tago ronatikor rego tivolor, libo ronazekor mero ronatikor aluko.
```

Breakdown:
- **[miko] ronazeko** = one hundred  
- **tiko ronatikor** = two tens  
- **zeko** = three  
- **zevolor** = (of) millions  
- **sano ronazekor** = four hundreds  
- **tago ronatikor** = five tens  
- **rego** = six  
- **tivolor** = (of) thousands  
- **libo ronazekor** = seven hundreds  
- **mero ronatikor** = eight tens  
- **aluko** = nine  

**Alternative notations**:
- Compact digit sequence:  
  `mi-ti-ze-san-tag-reg-lib-mer-aluko`  
- Hybrid form (ranks only where needed):  
  `mi-ti-zeko zevolor san-tag-rego tivolor lib-mer-aluko`

### **8.4. Special Cases: Zero**

Zero may be **omitted** in ranks where no other digit is present.  
If explicit mention is required, use the **negation prefix `nai-`** with the rank:

- **naironatiko** — no tens  
- **naironazeko** — no hundreds  
- **naitivolo** — no thousands  
- **naizevolo** — no millions  
- etc.

This treats zero not as a number, but as **absence within a rank**—consistent with Vokoba’s principle of semantic precision.

### **8.5. Decimal Fractions**

Negative exponents (i.e., decimal places) are formed using the infix **`-ne-`**, inserted between the base (`rona-`) and the digit:

- **0.1** = **[miko] ronanetiko** (ron + ne + ti + ko) — “one tenth”  
- **0.01** = **[miko] ronanezeko** — “one hundredth”  
- **0.001** = **[miko] ronanesano** — “one thousandth”  
- **0.03** = **zeko ronanezekor** — “three hundredths”

For complex decimals, the phrase **`neko pona`** (“zero point…”) may precede the fractional part:

- **123.456** = **miko ronazeko tiko ronatikor zeko *pona* sano ronazekor tago ronatikor rego**

### **8.6. Common Fractions**

The conjunction **`vi`** (“inside”, “within”) is used to express parts of a whole:

- **1/3** = **miko vi zekor** — “one within three”  
- **2/5** = **tiko vi tagor** — “two within five”  
- **21/13** = **tiko ronatikor miko vi [miko] ronatiko zekor** — “twenty-one within thirteen”  
  (The numerator 21 is expressed as *tiko ronatikor miko*; the denominator 13 as *miko ronatiko zeko*.)

Note the plural **`-r`** on the denominator: **zekor**, **tagor**. This reflects that the whole is **divided into multiple instances** of that unit (e.g., “three parts”, not “the number three”).

### **8.7. Ordinals and Special Forms**

- **mikolimi** — “only one”, “unique” (*miko-lim-i*: “one-limit-adjective”)  
- **tikoregi** — “second in sequence” (*tiko-reg-i*: “two-order-adjective”)  
- **mikoponu** — “firstly”, “in the first place” (*miko-pon-u*: “one-point-adverb”)
