### Word Endings for Parts of Speech (IMPORTANT: A root without an ending has no meaning!):

- **-a** / **-ka** — noun:
*lyma* — light as a phenomenon, *vita* — life, *esaka* — expression
- **-i** / **-ki** — adjective:
*lymi* — glowing, bright, *viti* — alive, *esaki* — expressive
- **-e** / **-ke** — verb:
*lyme* — to shine, *vite* — to live, *esake* — to express
- **-o** / **-ko** — number/numeral

More details on numerals in the corresponding section.

### Rule for Forming Compound Roots:

Roots can be combined to create more complex ideas.

1. **Core meaning**: The first root is the main one and sets the general meaning of the word.
2. **Modifiers**: Subsequent roots refine or modify the meaning of the first.
3. **Euphony**: A vowel (by default **o**) can be added between roots for better sound when the combination of two consonants seems difficult.

#### Examples:

- **davok** = **da** (existence) + **vok** (sound) → "sound".
- **bonkor** = **bon** (good) + **kor** (feeling) → "sympathy, love".
- **perogrureg** = **per** (person) + **gru** (heavy) + **reg** (order) → "tyrant".
- **meropur** = **mer** (liquid) + **pur** (purity) → "water".
- **esavok** = **esa** (expression) + **vok** (sound) → "speech".

### Plural Form

The plural is formed by adding the suffix "-r":
- *vita* — life, *vitar* — lives
- *esaka* — expression, *esakar* — expressions
- *pervita* — person, *pervitar* — people

This can also apply to other parts of speech, although in some cases it may seem redundant, but it helps clarify the context.

### Gender Differences
- *mika* - I (gender-neutral)
- *tika* - you (gender-neutral)
- *zeka* - it (third person neutral)
- *zekar* - they (third person neutral)
- *zemaka* - he
- *zejaka* - she

Additional variants for greater precision, if needed:
- *mimaka* - I (male)
- *mijaka* - I (female)
- *timaka* - you (to a male)
- *tijaka* - you (to a female)

These nouns also follow the rules for plural formation.

## 3. Sentence Structure

Sentences are formed according to the **TSVO** format, where **T** represents the temporal context, and **SVO** follows the standard word order (subject, verb, object).

### Time and Aspect:
Separate particles are used to indicate time and aspect of the action.

- **pa** — past
- **ta** — present
- **fa** — future
- **do** — completed action
- **no** — ongoing action

These particles can be combined, for example:
- **fano** — future + ongoing action
- **fado** — future + completed action
- **tano** — present + ongoing action
- **tado** — present + completed action
- **pano** — past + ongoing action
- **pado** — past + completed action

### Sentence Structure Particles:
- **si** — if
- **sida** — then
- **nesida** — otherwise

### Example:

**"si fado mika davime mona ni ja, sida fano mika davoke ja, nesida mika dake nevoki"** — "If in the future I have the thought about this, I will speak, otherwise, I will remain silent."

### Direction and Possession Particles:

- **ni** — possession, relativity (similar to Japanese "の"):
*lyma ni mika* — "my light"

- **vi** — inside:
*lyma vi mika* — "light inside me"

- **ot** — direction from:
*lyma ot mika* — "light from me"

- **do** — direction to:
*lyma do mika* — "light to (towards) me"

- **ta** — purpose:
*lyma ta mika* — "light for me"

- **je** — contextual marker (similar to "that" in English):
*si tika davime mona ni je, sida tika dake esavoki.* — "If you know about this, speak."

Particles also define the transitivity of verbs.

- **esavoke** — to express (intransitive).
- **Mika esavoke** — I express.
- **Mika esavoke do tiki monar** — I voice your thoughts.
- **Mika esavoke ta tiki monar** — I voice thoughts for you.
- **Mika esavoke je tiki monar** — I voice those very thoughts of yours.

### Negation Prefixes:

- **ne** — inversion prefix. *neboni* — "bad"
- **nai** — negation prefix: *naiboni* — "not good"

More particles may be introduced as the language develops.

### Examples:

**"pado mika vime lyma"** — "In the past, I saw the light."
- **pado** — past + completion
- **mika** — I
- **vime** — to perceive (verb)
- **lyma** — light

**"tano mika vime do lyma"** — "I'm looking at the light (right now)."
- **tano** — present + incompletion
- **mika** — I
- **vime** — to perceive
- **do**   — direction to
- **lyma** — light

**"[tano] mika davime grabonkora do tika"** — "I love you."
- **tano** — present + incompletion
- **mika** — I
- **davime** — to know (literally "existence perception verb")
- **grabonkora** — powerful/strong positive feeling
- **do tika** — to you

**"si tika davime mona ni je, sida esavoke, nesida nedavoki!"** — "If you know about this, speak, otherwise remain silent!"
- **si** — if
- **tika** — you
- **davime** — to know/to perceive
- **mona ni** — thought/knowledge of (something)
- **je** — context marker
- **sida** — then/means
- **esavoke** — to express with sound = to speak
- **nesida** — otherwise
- **nedavoki** — to remain silent (literally "not to be sounding")

**"ke tika davime mona ni je?"** — "Do you know about this?"

- **tika** — you
- **davime** — to know/to perceive
- **mona nije** — thought/knowledge of the context
