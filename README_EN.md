# Vokoba Language Manual

**Version: Alpha**  
**Date: May 2025**

Vokoba is an artificial language designed for simplicity, logical consistency, and flexibility. It avoids exceptions to rules and allows free combination of roots to express complex ideas. This manual outlines the fundamentals of the language, including the alphabet, grammar, word formation, and usage examples.

## 1. Alphabet and Phonetics

The Vokoba alphabet consists of **23 letters**, each corresponding to a single sound. Ambiguity in pronunciation is eliminated.

### Alphabet and Corresponding Sounds:
| Letter | Sound        | Example                      |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------|
| a      | /a/          | as in "mama"                 |
| b      | /b/          | as in "book"                 |
| d      | /d/          | as in "dog"                  |

| z      | /z/          | as in "zoo"                  |

**Note:** All sounds are pronounced clearly, without reduction. Stress typically falls on the first syllable unless otherwise specified.

## 2. Word Formation

### 2.1. Roots
Vokoba is built on **roots**—core concepts that combine to form complex meanings. A root without a part-of-speech suffix has no standalone meaning.

| zel  | /zɛl/         | dream, hope                            |

**Note:** The list of roots may expand. New roots are added with consideration for uniqueness and minimal overlap in meaning.

#### Part-of-Speech Suffixes:
- **-a / -ka** — noun (object or phenomenon): *lyma* — "light", *vita* — "life".
- **-i / -ki** — adjective (quality): *lymi* — "luminous", *viti* — "living".
- **-e / -ke** — verb (action): *lyme* — "to shine", *vite* — "to live".
- **-u / -ku** — adverb
- **-ai / -kai** — finitive (see Section 6).
- **-o / -ko** — number (digit): *miko* — "1", *tiko* — "2" (see "Numerals" section).

**Important:** A root without a suffix is not used independently.  
**Euphony:** If a root ends in a vowel, the part-of-speech suffix begins with "k" (-ka/-ki/-ke/-ku/-kai).

### 2.2. Formation of Compound Roots
Complex concepts are created by combining roots in two ways:

#### 2.2.1. Simple Combination
- **Description**: The first root provides the base, and subsequent roots refine it.
- **Part of Speech**: Determined by the suffix (-a, -i, -e, -o, -u).

Examples:
- *da-vok* (*da-vok-a*) — "existence + sound" → "sounding sound" (noun).
- *bon(-i)-kor* (*bon-i-kor-a*) — "good + feeling" → "sympathy" (noun).
- *mer(-a)-pur* (*mer-a-pur-a*) — "liquid + purity" → "drinking water" (noun).

#### 2.2.2. Combination with Internal Suffix
- **Description**: The first root describes a quality or action related to the second root.
- **Internal Suffix**: A part-of-speech suffix is inserted between roots to define their relationship.
- **Resulting Part of Speech**: A final suffix (-a/-ka, -i/-ki, -e/-ke, -u/-ku) determines the word’s role.

**Examples:**
- *pon-i-reg-a* — "point-like (*pon-i*) + order (*reg-a*)" → "line" (noun).
- *pon-i-reg-i* — "related to a line" (adjective).
- *pon-i-reg-e* — "to straighten" (verb).
- *mon-i-ob-a* — "thinking (*mon-i*) + object (*ob-a*)" → "thinking object" (noun).

### 2.3. Plural
The plural is formed by adding the suffix *-r*:
- *vita* — "life", *vitar* — "lives".
- *pona* — "point", *ponar* — "points".
- *mika* — "I", *mikar* — "we".

The suffix applies to all parts of speech, but in adjectives and verbs, it may be redundant if the context is clear.

### 2.4. Gender Distinctions
Personal pointers are gender-neutral by default but can be specified:
- *mika* — "I" (neutral), *mikar* — "we".
- *tika* — "you" (neutral), *tikar* — "you (plural)".
- *zeka* — "it" (neutral), *zekar* — "they".
- *zemaka* — "he", *zejaka* — "she".
- *mimaka* — "I" (male), *mijaka* — "I" (female).

## 3. Grammar

### 3.1. Sentence Structure
Basic structure: **[Q]TSVO[F]** ([question] + time + subject + verb + object + [finitive]).
- **Q (question)**: Marks a question and specifies the interrogative (who?, where?, when?, etc.).
- **T (time)**: Indicates temporal context and aspect. Can be omitted for axioms or eternal truths.
- **S (subject)**: Who or what performs the action.
- **V (verb)**: The action or state.
- **O (object)**: What the action affects (optional).
- **F (finitive)**: A special part of speech expressing the speaker’s attitude toward the statement (optional).

Example: *pado mika vime sora* — "In the past, I saw the sky."

#### Time and Aspect:
- **pa** — past, **ta** — present, **fa** — future.
- **do** — completed, **no** — ongoing.
Combinations:
- *pado* — "past completed",
- *tano* — "present ongoing",
- *fado* — "future completed".

#### Timeless (SVO):
- *kava kave* — "The river flows" (eternal truth).

### 3.2. Particles/Conjunctions
- **ni** — possession: *lyma ni mika* — "my light".
- **vi** — inside: *lyma vi vola* — "light in space".
- **ot** — from: *lyma ot mika* — "light from me".
- **do** — to: *lyma do tika* — "light to you".
- **ta** — for: *lyma ta mika* — "light for me".
- **je** — contextual marker ("that very"): *mona ni je* — "the thought about it".
- **si** — "if", **sida** — "then", **nesida** — "otherwise".
- **vesi** — "if only" (hypothetical).
- **nesi** — "if not".
- **tu** — "and".
- **ro** — "or".

### 3.3. Negation and Inversion
- **ne-** — inversion (opposite): *neboni* — "bad".
- **nai-** — negation (absence): *naiboni* — "not good".

---

## 4. Question Sentences
Structure: **Q + [T] + SVO + [F]**
- **Q** — question word, always at the beginning.
- **[T]** — time (optional).

### Question Words:
- *persu* — "who?", *obasu* — "what?", *volasu* — "where?".
- *temasu* — "when?", *esasu* — "how?", *genasu* — "why?".
- *dasu* — "for what purpose?", *sumasu* — "how many/much?", *filasu* — "whose?".

Example: *persu pado vime lyma?* — "Who saw the light in the past?"

---

## 6. Finitives

Finitives are a unique part of speech in Vokoba that express the **speaker’s emotional state or attitude** toward the statement. They always appear **at the end of a sentence** and do not modify the action or object but convey the speaker’s mood. Finitives are optional and used to express the speaker’s disposition.

### 6.1. Finitive Endings
- **-ai / -kai** — conversational register (neutral, everyday tone).
- **-aimu / -kaimu** — formal/polite register (formal speech, oaths, pledges).
- **-aizu / -kaizu** — poetic register (elevated, artistic tone).
- **-aiku / -kaiku** — sarcastic register (ironic, mocking tone).

### 6.2. Usage Rules
- **Position**: Finitives always appear at the end of a sentence. Only **one finitive** is allowed per sentence.
- **Root Combination**: To convey complex moods, up to two roots can be combined. The first root sets the primary tone, and the second refines it. A linking vowel (*-i-*, *-a-*, *-e-*) is added if needed for euphony.
  - Example: *bon-i-kor-ai* — "joyfully and passionately".
- **Negation**: Finitives can use prefixes *nai-* (absence) or *ne-* (opposite) to alter the mood.
  - Example: *nebonai* — "with regret", *naikorai* — "without enthusiasm".
- **Question Finitives**: The finitive *resai* (or its compound forms) can be used for rhetorical or emotional questions without an initial question word.
  - Example: *Tika vime lyma resai?* — "Did you see the light? I’m curious."
- **Ellipsis**: In dialogue, a finitive can replace an entire sentence, expressing mood as a standalone response or statement.
  - Examples:
    - *Lyma lyme?* ("Is it shining?") → *Altai!* ("I say solemnly: yes!").
    - *Resenamai?* ("What’s your name?") — Literally "I asked, inquiring about the name."

### 6.3. Finitive Examples
| Root   | Finitive | Mood                       | Example Sentence                             |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **kor** (emotion) | *korai* | passionately, enthusiastically | *Mika vime lyma korai!* — "I saw the light! (I’m enthusiastic)" |
| **suf** (vagueness) | *sufai* | uncertainly, doubtfully    | *Zeka monapake sufai...* — "He knows... (I’m doubtful)" |
| **bon** (goodness) | *bonai* | joyfully, approvingly      | *Tika zamke bonai!* — "You did it! (I’m joyful)" |
| **alt** (height) | *altai* | solemnly, exaltedly        | *Lyma lyme altai!* — "The light shines! (solemnly)" |
| **fra** (freedom) | *frakai* | lightly, carefree          | *Venke frakai!* — "Let’s go! (I’m carefree)" |

| **san** (health) | *sanai* | caringly                   | *Tika zamke sanai!* — "You did it! (with care)" |
| **pul** (interaction) | *pulai* | friendly, openly           | *Tika venke pulai!* — "You walk. (friendly)" |

### 6.4. Compound Finitives
Compound finitives combine two roots to convey complex moods:
- *bon-i-kor-ai* — "joyfully and passionately": *Pado tika zamke bonikorai!* — "(stats) "You did it! (with joy and passion)"
- *suf-i-res-ai* — "uncertainly and questioningly": *Pado zeka vime lyma sufiresai?* — "Did he see the light? (with doubt and curiosity)"
- *zel-i-fra-ai* — "dreamily and carefree": *Mika venke zelifrai!* — "I walk. (dreamily and carefree)"

### 6.5. Registers in Action
- Conversational (*-ai*): *Mika vime lyma korai!* — "I saw the light! (with enthusiasm)"
- Poetic (*-aizu*): *Lyma lyme altaizu!* — "The light shines! (solemnly and poetically)"
- Sarcastic (*-aiku*): *Mika vime lyma koraiku!* — "I saw the light. (with enthusiasm, but not really)!"

### 6.6. Action Modification
A finitive can include an additional root to specify the form of the statement:
- *Tika zamke je resevitai?* — "Did you do it? I ask energetically." (*res-e* = question-verb)
- *Tika zamke je grakeaktai!* — "You will do it! I command!" (*gra-ke* = authority-verb)

### 6.7. Dialogue Examples
1. **Simple Dialogue**:
   - A: *Tika vime lyma?* — "Did you see the light?"
   - B: *Korai!* — "Yes! (with enthusiasm)"
   - A: *Esasu?* — "How?"
   - B: *Pado vime zelai!* — "Yesterday. (with hope)"

2. **Sarcastic Response**:
   - A: *Tika zamke?* — "Did you do it?"
   - B: *Bonaiku!* — "Oh, sure! (sarcasm)"

3. **Rhetorical Question**:
   - *Zeka monapake ni je sufiresai?* — "Does he know it? (I ask with doubt and curiosity)"

### 6.8. Notes
- Finitives do not replace adverbs, which describe the manner of action. Finitives (*-ai* and others) express the speaker’s attitude toward the action, while adverbs (*-u/-ku*) describe how the action occurs.

## 8. Number System in Vokoba

### 8.1. Basic Numbers

Vokoba uses a numerical system based on grouping and place values. Numbers are formed by combining digits and place markers in a consistent structure.

#### 8.1.1. Basic Digits
- **miko** — 1 (my digit)
- **tiko** — 2 (your digit)
- **zeko** — 3 (their digit)
- **sano** — 4 (healthy digit)
- **tago** — 5 (segmented digit)
- **rego** — 6 (ordered digit)
- **frako** — 7 (free digit)
- **mero** — 8 (liquid digit)
- **alto** — 9 (high digit)

(Names in parentheses are mnemonic aids.)

These digits are used to form larger numbers when combined with place markers.

#### 8.1.2. Quantity Words
- **gratika** — ten (power + two)
- **grazeka** — hundred (power + three)

### 8.2. Place Value Units
Place values define larger magnitudes, such as tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.:
- **-vola/-volar** — place marker for large numbers (millions, billions, etc.)
- **tivola** — thousand (10^3)
- **zevola** — million (10^6)
- **sanvola** — billion (10^9)

### 8.3. Number Grouping
Numbers are grouped by place value, with each group representing a specific magnitude.

#### 8.3.1. Forming Large Numbers
Each group represents a place value, and the number within each group is formed using digits and place markers:
- **1,000,000** = **[miko] zevola**
- **1,000** = **miko tivola**
- **123,000,000,000** = **miko grazeka tiko gratikar zeko sanvolar**

#### 8.3.2. Combining Place Values and Numbers
The number **123,456,789** is written as:
```
[miko] grazeka tiko gratikar zeko zevolar, sano grazekar tago gratikar rego tivolar, frako grazekar mero gratikar alto
```
Where:
- **[miko] grazeka** = [one] hundred
- **tiko gratikar** = two tens
- **zeko** = three
- **zevolar** = millions
- **sano grazekar** = four hundreds
- **tago gratikar** = five tens
- **rego** = six
- **tivolar** = thousands
- **frako grazekar** = seven hundreds
- **mero gratikar** = eight tens
- **alto** = nine

Alternatively, a shorthand form can be used:
```
mi-ti-ze-san-tag-reg-fra-mer-alto
```

### 8.4. Special Cases
- **Zero**: Zero can be omitted in place values with no digits or expressed as **neko** (no digit).
  - **neko** — zero
  - **negratiko** — no tens
  - **negrazeko** — no hundreds
  - **netivola** — no thousands
  - **nezevola** — no millions
  - And so forth.

### 8.5. Decimal Fractions
Use *-ne-* for negative powers:
- 0.1 = [miko] granetiko (power + negative + two + digit) = [one] tenth
- 0.01 = [miko] granezeko (power + negative + three + digit) = [one] hundredth
- 0.001 = [miko] granesano (power + negative + four + digit) = [one] thousandth
- 0.03 = zeko granezekor = three hundredths

For complex decimals, use *neko pona* ("zero point") followed by the standard system:
- 123.456 = miko grazeka tiko gratikar zeko *pona* sano grazekar tago gratikar rego

### 8.6. Fractions
The particle **vi** (inside) is used to express fractions:
- 1/3 = *miko vi zekor* = one inside three
- 2/5 = *tiko vi tagor* = two inside five
- 21/13 = *tiko gratikar miko vi [miko] gratika zekor* = two tens and one inside [one] ten and three (*miko* can be omitted)

Note the plural form of the denominator, indicating multiple units (e.g., three "thirds", five "fifths").
