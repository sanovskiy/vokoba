# Vokoba

**Version: Alpha**  
**Date: November 2025**

> An experiment in re-engineering the very mechanism of language

Vokoba is an *a priori oligosynthetic* language that rejects the chaos of natural languages and the cold sterility of logical languages in favor of a new paradigm: **direct image encoding**.

Vokoba does not use word-labels. Instead, it operates with "conceptual atoms" — roots that are combined to synthesize meaning, much like thought combines images. It is a language where context becomes a resource: grammatical markers explicitly point to shared knowledge, while the system of **finitives** integrates emotional nuance into the very structure of a sentence.

Vokoba's goal is to become not merely a means of communication, but an **operating system for the mind**, fostering clarity, systematic thinking, and self-reflection.
